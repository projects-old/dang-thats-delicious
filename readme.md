## Dang That's Delicious App - Learn Node Course by Wes Bos

- Travis CI: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/stmapman7/dang-thats-delicious.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/stmapman7/dang-thats-delicious)

## What is this?

Create a restaurant/store, visit another one, and add a user review!

![Store Sample](https://github.com/stmapman7/dang-thats-delicious/blob/master/public/images/photos/Store-image.jpg)

## Sample Data

To load sample data, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run sample
```

If you have previously loaded in this data, you can wipe your database 100% clean with:

```bash
npm run blowitallaway
```

That will populate 16 stores with 3 authors and 41 reviews. The logins for the authors are as follows:

|Name|Email (login)|Password|
|---|---|---|
|Wes Bos|wes@example.com|wes|
|Debbie Downer|debbie@example.com|debbie|
|Beau|beau@example.com|beau|
